// Infinite iterators are also possible. For instance, the range becomes infinite for range.to = Infinity. Or we can
// make an iterable object that generates an infinite sequence of pseudorandom numbers. Also can be useful. There are
// no limitations on next, it can return more and more values, thatâ€™s normal. Of course, the for..of loop over such an
// iterable would be endless. But we can always stop it using break.
