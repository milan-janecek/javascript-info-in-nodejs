This is not a good example of node.js project.

It is just to demonstrate mocha & chai.

It was created by running:

```$xslt
yarn init
yarn add chai mocha
```

And the 2 files in the project:


- `pow-test.js`
- `before-after-demo.js`

Are there just to demonstrate some mocha & chai features.

That said, yarn was used to add mocha & chai to the project.
